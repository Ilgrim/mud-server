OLC

The OLC, or online creation system, is based loosely (command naming and output) on the style
used by the ROM mud server's OLC <insert some history here>. Not all the commands are the same,
although they may in the future be revised to match, so as to allow ease of use by people familiar
with that style of building.

NOTE: as of right now, there is no area system, only the links which connect any room to any other
room, so there is that in favor of difference.

utilities:
