MOVEMENT

Movement on this server borrows from more roleplaying styled games in that there
are named exits rather than directional ones. It is possible that directional 
comamnds might be added, but at present they are absent. Also, there is some
notion of position within a room, but as of now there is no reliable means
of moving within a room.
