CHAT

Command to chat with other players via various channels.

Syntax: 'chat <channel> <message>'
        'chat <channel> #listeners'
        'chat #channels'            list channels that exists (shows enabled, disabled if you are in/not in it)

* additionally the command interpreter supports the following "aliasing" '<channel name> <message>',
for example 'ooc Hello, world!' will produce the same result as 'chat ooc Hello, world!'
